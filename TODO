# TODO

- Add README (Mention that due to the heavy traffic flowing in, it might be beneficial to setup cloud flare caching
- Remove auto refresh from public log (not needed, causes enormous amount of unnecessary traffic)
- Fix public log to serve assets from a CDN instead of our server 
- Add CherryPy as the server, while keeping Flask as the framework
- Add check for Drawing threads started earlier and warn the user/stop them before beginning a new one
